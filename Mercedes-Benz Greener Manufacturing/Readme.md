# Mercedes-Benz Greener Manufacturing Project

This project aims to reduce the time spent on the test bench for Mercedes-Benz cars by developing an algorithmic approach. The goal is to optimize the testing system and achieve faster testing without compromising safety and efficiency. The dataset provided represents different feature combinations in a Mercedes-Benz car, and the task is to predict the time it takes to pass testing. By reducing testing time, the project aims to contribute to lower carbon dioxide emissions while maintaining Daimler's standards.

## Problem Statement Scenario

Daimler, as one of the world's largest manufacturers of premium cars, prioritizes safety and efficiency on its production lines. However, optimizing the testing system for numerous feature combinations is challenging and time-consuming without powerful algorithms. The project seeks to address this challenge and reduce the time spent on the test bench.

## Actions to be Performed

1. Remove Variables with Zero Variance: If any column(s) have zero variance, they will be removed as they provide no useful information.

2. Check for Null and Unique Values: The dataset will be inspected for null values and unique values in both the test and train sets. These values need to be handled appropriately during preprocessing.

3. Apply Label Encoder: Categorical variables will be encoded using label encoding to convert them into numerical representation for modeling purposes.

4. Perform Dimensionality Reduction: Dimensionality reduction techniques will be applied to reduce the number of features while preserving important information. This helps in improving model performance and reducing computation time.

5. Predict Test Data: The XGBoost algorithm will be used to predict the values of the test dataset based on the trained model.

## Project Files

The project includes the following files:

1. `train.csv`: CSV file containing the training dataset.
2. `test.csv`: CSV file containing the test dataset.
3. `README.md`: Markdown file providing an overview of the project (you are currently reading it).

For detailed code and analysis, refer to the Jupyter Notebook or Python script files provided.

## Instructions

To run the project and reproduce the analysis:

1. Download the `train.csv` and `test.csv` files.
2. Install the necessary libraries and dependencies.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script files.
4. Follow the step-by-step instructions within the code to perform data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and model training.
5. Use the trained model to predict the test dataset values.

Note: The project assumes a basic understanding of Python, data analysis, and machine learning concepts.

By optimizing the testing system, we can contribute to greener manufacturing at Mercedes-Benz. Enjoy working on the project!
